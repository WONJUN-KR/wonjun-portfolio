  coverLetter: `## Full-stack developer for CGM medical device services

Full-stack developer at a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) medical device company, running six projects at once, from React and Next.js frontends to Spring Boot and Flask backends, AWS infrastructure, and deployment.

Built keyless CI/CD with blue/green zero-downtime deploys at no extra cost, and moved two on-premises services to AWS with zero data loss and about 2.5 minutes of downtime. On a legacy data platform, grew tests from 0 to 211 and cut a 20-second query to 0.6 seconds.

Works on one rule: medical data must never lose a row, and the service must never stop. Backs up, dry-runs, and fully reconciles before changing production data.`,
};
